## Introduction

If you're interested in Kotlin Multiplatform (Compose Multiplatform) with Clean Architecture, feel free to take a look.

Kmp-Starter-Template  
https://github.com/DevAtrii/Kmp-Starter-Template

This project is for learning and technical practice.

It can also be paired with my Go backend boilerplate to demonstrate a full-stack mobile application architecture.

---

## Related Backend

This project can be used together with my Go backend boilerplate:

- [rest-boilerplate-refined-go](https://github.com/tenSunFree/rest-boilerplate-refined-go)

The backend project provides a RESTful API foundation built with Go, Gin, PostgreSQL, sqlx, Redis, JWT, Docker, and Clean Architecture.

It can serve as the server-side foundation for authentication, user management, API development, and backend infrastructure practice.

## Features

### Secure Storage

- Android: Secure session storage using DataStore + Tink AEAD AES256-GCM backed by Android Keystore
- iOS: Secure credential storage using Keychain (`kSecClassGenericPassword`) with `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly`

### Lesson Player

- YouTube video playback via `android-youtube-player:core:13.0.0`
- Custom playback controls (play / pause / seek) with YouTube native controls hidden
- Time-synced bilingual captions (English + Traditional Chinese) driven by API response (`startMs` / `endMs`)
- Auto-scroll caption list to highlight the current caption in real time
- Vocabulary teaching items linked to specific caption timestamps
- Playback progress timer managed by ViewModel with periodic progress updates
- Seek-only sync to YouTube player via `seekToMs`, preventing frame drops caused by continuous seek calls

---

## Tech Stack

- Kotlin Multiplatform  
  Shared Android / iOS application foundation (Uses commonMain for shared business logic, UI foundation, persistence abstractions, and expect/actual contracts to isolate platform-specific providers such as DataStore, database setup, intents, screen utilities, and native integrations)
- Modular Clean Architecture  
  Feature-isolated layered Gradle module graph (Organizes features into independent data, domain, and presentation modules, where domain owns repository contracts and use-case logic, data provides concrete implementations, and presentation depends inward on domain APIs instead of reaching data directly)
- MVI ViewModel  
  Unidirectional state management with typed UI contracts (Uses MviViewModel<STATE, ACTIONS, EVENTS> to model screen state, user actions, and one-time events, forcing UI interactions through a centralized onAction() entry point while updating state through StateFlow-based immutable state transitions)
- Navigation3 with ResultStore  
  Type-safe Navigation3 back stack infrastructure (Defines routes as @Serializable NavKey screens, registers screen subclasses for saveable back stack restoration, renders destinations through NavDisplay with Koin entry providers, and wraps navigation operations inside StarterNavigator with ResultStore support for screen-to-screen result passing)
- Build Logic Convention Plugins  
  Programmatic Gradle module standardization (Implements reusable Plugin<Project> convention plugins such as CommonPlugin, ComposeMultiplatformPlugin, KoinPlugin, and KoinComposePlugin to apply shared plugins, dependencies, and Compose/Koin configuration consistently across feature modules)
- Secure Storage  
  Cross-platform credential protection with platform-native security backends (Android encrypts session data with Tink AEAD AES256-GCM backed by Android Keystore; iOS persists credentials in the system Keychain using `kSecClassGenericPassword` with `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly`)
- android-youtube-player Integration  
  Native Android YouTube embedding via `YouTubePlayerView` inside Compose using `android-youtube-player:core:13.0.0`. Uses `IFramePlayerOptions` to hide native controls, blocks direct interaction on the video surface with a transparent overlay, and synchronizes play / pause / seek commands from Compose state.
